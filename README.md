The rodent data for this project was taken from a json in opendata.cityofnewyork.us 
The map was created with openstreetmap.org It is zoomable and mobile responsive.
The heat markers were programmed with JavaScript and stylized with leaflet and CSS. If you hover over a cluster, it will outline the streets itâ€™s representing. A blue marker means only 1 rodent has been recorded.
